# Acoustic_ImpedancePINN
This repository implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) designed for high-fidelity inversion of acoustic impedance from seismic data. The codebase is highly optimized for GPU acceleration, multi-scale modeling, adaptive physical loss, and homogeneous zone handling, using PyTorch.
